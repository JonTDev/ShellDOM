# ShellDOM
### Summary
The idea here is to submit JSON to the main function.  This function will then add events to the JSON and so that as you update that object it will also take your targets and update them as it is receiving the JSON.  So as the new data comes in you simple just need to update the JSON to re-update the fields.  This can be done using DOM Elements, Web Sockets, or even AJAX.

## TODO

 - [x] Main Concept
 - [x] Two way data DOM Element to update the JSON and vice versa.

 - [ ] AJAX update Method
 - [ ] Templates for data I.E. multiple rows of data.
